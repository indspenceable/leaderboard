# Leaderboard
This is a simple website that I made to start keeping track of our gaming 
history at work. Every time you play a board game, just mark it down on this
website. Eventually, you'll be able to see your records over the long run, 
and filter by things like opponents, number of players in a game, wins, and
more.

The idea of the app was to be very simple - you will be able to add in more
details on any specific aspect that you want, in the long run, but to use the
app you should only need to enter the game name and the names of the winners
and losers.

## Todo

* Update models so that they only create connections after save, OR, so that they create connections if those attributes are set.
* Game Aliases. BSG and Battlestar Galactica should point to the samething.
* Offer autocorrect for game names.
* Add image functionality for games. Every time a game is displayed, it should show the image for that game.
* Filtering on a players games
* Pagination on everything.
* Add player details (preferences, age, location, email, etc)
* Add game details (number of players, game notes for a particularly epic game, etc)
* Add game tags (strategy, coop, etc)
* How do you deal with draws?
